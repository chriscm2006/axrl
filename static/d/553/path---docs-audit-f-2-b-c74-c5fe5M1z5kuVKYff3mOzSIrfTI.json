{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Object types</h2>\n<h3>SoftwareDescription</h3>\n<p>Accessibility testing often involves testing multiple pages of a website, or multiple views of an app. A software description sets the scope for a collection of web pages, or a set of views in an app, for which accessibility audits are performed. There are no rules on how to scope a software description. The scope of a software description should be defined in a way that best suites the people responsible for its development and maintainence.</p>\n<p>Larger software often has multiple teams responsible for different parts. For example, the website of a bank often has public site, a authentication area, a account management system, etc.. Each of these areas gets its own softwareDescription. Use the <code>sub_components</code> property to reference SoftwareDescriptions that are contained within a larger application.</p>\n<p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> The SoftwareDescription in other contexts is often called a \"project\". This word was not used because it creates a language of treating accessibility as a project, rather than as a process.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"@type\": \"WebSiteDescription\", // Extension to schema.org/WebSite\n  \"name\": \"Deque University\",\n  \"homepage\": \"https://dequeuniversity.com/\",\n  \"scope\": [\n    \"https://*.deuque.com/*\",\n    \"!https://.deuque.com/demo/\"\n  ],\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Organisation\", // From Schema.org\n    \"name\": \"Deque Systems\",\n    \"url\": \"https://deque.com/\"\n  },\n  \"sub_components\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"WebSiteDescription\",\n      \"name\": \"Attest HTML user guide\",\n      \"homepage\": \"https://dequeuniversity.com/guide/attest/\",\n      \"scope\": \"https://dequeuniversity.com/guide/attest/*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Auditor</h3>\n<h3>AuditResult</h3>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 07, 2017","path":"/docs/audit","title":"AXRL Audits"}}},"pageContext":{}}
